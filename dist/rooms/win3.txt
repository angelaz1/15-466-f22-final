You hear a familiar, faint sound. Is it from the lab you used to work in? Is it something that reminded you of what life used to be?

No. 

It is your 5th backup alarm. It is now 10:30 am on a Thursday. You are late for your 15-466 Game Programming class. Your game4 still only renders tofu, and you must have fallen asleep yesterday trying to solve it.

You already missed game 2. 

The game ends here, but your real nightmare has just begun.
