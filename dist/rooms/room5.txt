Wondering whatâ€™s below, you open the glass door and walk out to the balcony. Your steps leaving clear footprints on the thin layer of dust tells you that it must have been a while since the space was occupied. You peak your head out of the balcony banister. More tables and chairs covered in dust. You see a whiteboard filled with equations at a distance below. Perhaps it might have some information that might lead to a cure! You want to get closer to the board, but the balcony is too far away from the floor.
