As your eyes start to close, a lightning bolt of inspiration jolts you up. From somewhere, a memory of a formula you’ve seen recently. Zombie blood! By adding blood to your cure, you could immunize-!

With a jolt of adrenaline, you get back to your feet, grabbing ingredients from shelves and feverishly mixing them together. You feel the wound turning numb, the poison spreading through your body as you pour and heat the mixture. Finally, the last ingredient - you scoop up some of the blood from the pool around the prostrate zombie, and watch it drip down your fingers into the liquid. You lift the beaker to your lips and swallow.

At first, nothing happened. But then, you feel the pain receding, reducing to a small burning sensation where you’ve been bitten. You’ve done it!
